proj-euler
==========

Just a place to showcase my project euler solutions. Not all the solutions are super-clean code, some are quick and dirty solutions; but all work unless something mysteriously broke. And some problems are quite trivial once you figure out the intuitive step (which is usually mathematical) to solve them. Nevertheless, your knowledge of math and computer science will dance as more problems are solved.

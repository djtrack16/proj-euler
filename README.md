proj-euler
==========

Just a place to showcase my project euler solutions. I do this for fun and to stay sharp algorithmically: not all the solutions are super-clean, super-readable code, some are quick and dirty solutions; but all work (iirc). And some problems are quite trivial once you figure out the intuitive step (which is usually mathematical) to solve them. Nevertheless, your knowledge of math and computer science will dance as more problems are solved.

Try some out yourself: I recommend 490. Start with the hardest: then it will always be easier the further you go :P

If you like Project Euler, I'd also recommend "Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science" by Graham, Knuth, & Patashnik.
